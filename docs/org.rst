AWS Organizations
==================================

**Context:**
 Document to give an easy to read overview of what an AWS Organization is, and how to create additional OU's and accounts along with Users and Groups.

**Goals:**
 After traversing this document, you should have the initial knowledge and ability needed to create an OU, Account, IAM User, IAM Group within our organizations. 
   


What is an AWS Organization:
-------------------------
- It is an account management services that allows you to consolidate multiple accounts into an Organization that you create and centrally manage them.

By **default** when an AWS account is opened, it is a **standalone** account. When it is converted to use Organizations. That same initial standalone account now becomes the **master** account. Any other accounts created now within the organization have the heiarchy of being **member** aacounts. This will be referenced below. 

What functionality is provided:
-------------------------------
- This allows environemnt to keep track of and structure environments that may be large in size with 'realitive' ease. 
- Consolidated billing for all member accounts
- Hierarchical grouping of your accounts to meet budgetary, security, and compliance needs
- Control over AWS Services
- Intergration and support for IAM



**Walk-thru** Creating AWS Account within an Organization
--------------------------------------------

At this point we manage IAM Users and IAM Groups via a toolset called AWS-ORGS. 
Files needed to be updated to either create a new **IAM User**, **IAM Group**, or **Member Account** within our Organization.
::

  /home/djr/.awsorgs/spec.d
  [djr@hostname .awsorgs]$ cd spec.d/

  [djr@hostname spec.d]$ ls
  accounts-specs.yml  custom-policy-spec.yml  groups-spec.yml       orgs-spec.yml  teams-spec.yml
  common.yml          delegations-spec.yml    local-users-spec.yml  sc_policy.yml  users-spec.yml

Teams
=====
teams-spec.yml file - team definition file, this file is for ease of understanding who reports to who, what team a person is part of at UCOP. 

- make note of the NAME of the team that best fits the REAL USER.  Note if none of the TEAMS fit, a new team can be added. All fields must be filled out.
::

  - Name: operations     <--- make this name meaningful with good.    
      Description: Widget Administrators 
      BusinessContacts:
        - mickey.mouse@company.com
      TechnicalContacts:
        - dumbo@company.com


IAM Users
=====
users-spec.yml file - User definition file. Structure of file is as follows.

The purpose of this file is to CREATE an IAM user in AWS for team members. These IAM users that are created will then be placed into a group (next step).
- The real person you are creatingthis account for, place their information into the file. Required fields are (Name, Email, Team) 
- NOTE: Remember you should of already made note of the team to put this user in from the previous step.

- IMPORTANT NOTE: Indention in field as seen below is very picky. Misallign rows will result in errors.
- Lets add the new team member Scooby Doo to AWS. His username is: sdoo
::

  users:
    # 
    - Name: scrappy
      Email: scrappy@company.com
      Team: buildops
    - Name: dopey
      Email: dopey@company.com
      Team: TechSupport
    - Name: sdoo     < --- New user added
      Email: sdoo@company.com  < --- important that the users VALID email is here
      Team: operations   < -- member of team 


IAM Groups
======

groups-spec.yml file - groups definition file. Structure of file is as follows.

- This file is used to place individual IAM users that are created into IAM groups. These trusted IAM groups are than associated with roles needed to manage newly created member accounts. If we just associated IAM users to new member accounts it would be too complex to manage. 
- NOTE: All IAM Users are automatically inherited into the group "UserSelfService" by the definiion of the coding that has been done. This group however only allows IAM users to do such things as (change password, MFA, create keys..)
::

  AWS Auth Groups Specification
  groups:
    # seg
    - Name: all-users
      Members: ALL
      Policies:
        - UserSelfService
    - Name: admins
      Ensure: present
      Members:
        - dopey
        - scrappy
        - sdoo    < -- Added new user to group (admins)


Delegations
===========

delegations-spec.yml - delegation definition file. Structure of file is as follows.
- This file kind of says what the word says "delegates" what Trusted group can actually do in the newly created member account.
- The glue that ties it all together

- RoleName: Defined in a policy wihin the IAM Group
- TrustingAccount: Target member account(s) the ROLE will be able to assume to.
- TrustedGroup: The IAM group that has IAM user witin it, this group has policies created in it that define Roles which allow a user who is part of that group to Assume a role into another member account.
- RequiredMFA:  ensures it is utilized
- Policies: Service Control Policies as they are called in an organization setup. The services listed and only those services listed are alowed to be used. An explicit allow is used, therefore, all other services are dneied. This is done in a 'whitelisting' of services format. IMPORTANT NOTE: An IAM User or IAM Group that has FULL Administration access are still bound by these policies. The Service Control Policies SUPERCEDES orginal IAM USER and Group permissions.
::


  # supers
    - RoleName: SuperAdmin
    Ensure: present
    Description:  developer access
    TrustingAccount:
      - goofy-dev
      - pluto-qa
      - mydatacenter
    TrustedGroup: admins
    RequireMFA: True
    Policies:
      - PowerUserAccess
      - LimitedIAM
      - LimitedRoute53
      - ServiceCatalogEndUserFullAccess
      - CascadeServiceUserAccessKeys

ORGS
====

Org-spec.yml - Organization location file. Structure file as follows.

- IMPORTANT: Read the descrption at the top of the file.

The following file is basically the 'tree' structure of the Organization. There are parent and child OU's. Beneath both, accounts can be created. Depending on where you define your new account in this file is where it will be created based off the tree structure.

IMPORTANT NOTES TO UNDERSTAND
- If you look at the organizational tree, you will notice that there is a ROOT OU and many CHILD OU's. Notice there is only one account in the ROOT OU, and all others are in a CHILD OU. There can be up to 5 level's of CHILD OU's, but as of now we only go down one level. There can also be N+1 member accounts in any given OU, root or child.

- So to add a new account to the Organization we would modify this file and place the necessary information in the proper location.We are going to add a new account in the child OU (poc-accounts) 

So after we add the account to the proper OU, what exact permission will the account have, what can it do and not do?
- The permissions are exlpicit and filter down from the parent. If we are adding the account "disney-poc" to the OU "poc-accounts". We can see there is no Explicit policies located in its SC_Policies. So what will govern its authority to utilize resources is the PARENT OU? The Parent OU rights filter down to this Child OU.

- In the case of the OU called "build-account". There is an explicit policy on this OU, therefore, this OU can ONLY do what is located within the policy. 

Example of the file is:
::


  organizational_units:
    - Name: root
      Accounts:
        -Master
      Child_OU:
        - Name: authentication
          SC_Policies:
            - auth-only
          Accounts:
            - Auth
        - Name: datacenter
          SC_Policies:
          Accounts:
            - mydatacenter
        - Name: poc-accounts
          SC_Policies:
          Accounts:
            - test-poc
            - test1-poc
            - device-poc
            - administrator-poc
            - disney-poc     < -- Added this account to the organization.
        - Name: build-accounts
          SC_Policies:
            - build-account-policy
          Accounts:
            - junkdev
            - hacksville
        - Name: prod
          SC_Policies:
          Accounts:
            - hack-prod





Accounts
========
  
Account-specs.yml file - Structure of file. Note read discription at top of file. 

- To add a new account follow the example, reqired fields are (Name, Team, Alias) note reference to Email in decription of file.
::

  accounts:
    - Name: widget
      Team: operations
      Alias: widgetops
      Email: wo@company.com
    - Name: mydatacenter  < --- We are adding this new account
      Team: operations    < -- what team is using this account
      Alias: datacenter01 < -- the alias for the new account. you can use this alias to assume role
      Email:awsaccount@company.com  < -- Although this email address really does not matter, it must be 100% unique within AWS.

Walk-thru on creating IAM Users and IAM Groups

  Groups:
  - arn:aws:iam::215824054945:group/awsauth/admins
  - arn:aws:iam::215824054945:group/awsauth/all-users


  (python36) [djr@hostname spec.d]$ awsloginprofile --new sdoo  < -- This will create your loginprofile and send you and email with further steps.

  NOTE: if you make an OOPS: you and maybe make a typo in one of the User/Group Spec files and you receive an error upon trying to create the User.
 
  On the next pass of trying to create the account, use the following syntax instead.

  awsloginprofile --update sdoo   < --- dry run only
  awsloginprofile --update sdoo --exec    < -- execute command


Example **loginprofile** email
::

  Dear User,

  You have been granted access to our central AWS authentication account.  From here you can assume designated roles into other AWS accounts in our Organization.

  You must complete the following tasks to configure your access:


  1) Use the credentials below to log into the AWS console.  You will be required to change your password as you log in.  The rules for good passwords are as follows:

  - Minimum password length: 8
  - Require at least one uppercase character from Latin alphabet. (A-Z)
  - Require at least one lowercase character from Latin alphabet. (a-z)
  - Require at least one symbol. (!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-=[]{}|')
  - Require at least one number. (0-9)

  IMPORTANT: your one time password will expire after 24 hours.

  IAM User Name:       sdoo
  One Time Password:    Unedited:Pierced*Desirous+158
  Login URL:            https://mydatacenter.signin.aws.amazon.com/console




Creating Member Accounts
========================

All the above information is kind of housekeeping and an informal introduction into what is needed to create a new account.

- The mechanism used to create new member accounts within the Organization is the 'AWS-ORGS' toolset.

- In order to create a fully functioning account within an Organization than the following information is needed that was fully covered above.

Required info:
(update or gather information from the following files)
1. users-spec.yml
2. groups-spec.yml
3. teams-spec.yml
4. orgs-spec.yml
5. accounts-specs.yml
6. delegations-spec.yml

These commands will create the new member account based off the information you have supplied in the files lsted above in "Required info"
::

  # Create Account


  $ awsaccounts create --config /home/djr/.awsorgs/config.yaml --spec-dir /home/djr/.awsorgs/spec.d --master-account-id "222222222222" --auth-account-id "3333333333333" --org-access-role SuperAdmin    < -- dryrun only


  $ awsaccounts create --config /home/djr/.awsorgs/config.yaml --spec-dir /home/djr/.awsorgs/spec.d --master-account-id "222222222222" --auth-account-id "3333333333333" --org-access-role SuperAdmin    < --  execute command


  # Delegation 
  $ awsauth delegations  < --  dryrun only
  $ awsauth delegations --exec   < -- execute command
