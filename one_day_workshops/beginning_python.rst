Learning to Program in Python
=============================

There is no way to realistically learn to program in python within a 
3-hour workshop.  But we hope at least to get you started.

You will be working from your python3 virtual environment you set up in
the previous workshop `Linux Workstation Setup`_.



Tutorials
---------

Take your pick from the following suggestions.  They are all good.


The Official Python 3 Tutorial
******************************

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

See how far you get. Start with section 3 - `An Informal Introduction to Python`_

Try to get through sections:

- 4 - `More Control Flow Tools`_
- 5 - `Data Structures`_


Python for You and Me
*********************

https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

This one is my favorite.  Again just see how far you get.  Skip the sections
on `Installation` and `Using mu editor`.



Video Turorial
--------------

Automate the Boring Stuff
*************************
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW

This series of videos accompany a book by the same name by Al Sweigart

Users can skip lesson 1.  This talks mostly about installing python.


use cloud9 ide or any text editor instead of 'idle'


Please use earphones if viewing this in class.
