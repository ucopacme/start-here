One Day Workshops
=================


The AWS Infrastructure team is presenting a series of currated
hands-on AWS trainings for TDS staff.  These trainings will focus on skills
needed to develop and support AWS infrastructure as code.

Each One Day Workshop focuses on a specific topic and should take around three
hours to complete.  Together the workshops are organized to provide a coherent
curriculum.  The skills mastered in one are built upon in the next.

The workshops are self-paced and accommodate a range of AWS experience levels;
from first time users just getting started, to gurus ready to master
programming in the python SDK.  They focus less on teaching about AWS resources
and more on developing comfort at the command line and good coding practices
such as unit testing, packaging and automated self-documentation.
